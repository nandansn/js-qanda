// In JavaScript, a polyfill is a piece of code that provides functionality that is not natively supported by a web browser. It "fills in" the gaps in a web browser's implementation of certain features or APIs, allowing developers to write code that works consistently across different browsers and platforms. Polyfills are often used to support new or experimental features in older browsers, or to add support for new APIs that have not yet been widely adopted.

// Promises: Provides a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable way. It's a common polyfill that provides support for Promises in older browsers.

// Object.assign: This polyfill allows you to merge two or more objects into one. It is useful for merging objects in a cross-browser compatible way.

// Array.from: This polyfill allows you to convert an array-like object (such as a NodeList or arguments object) into an actual array.

// requestAnimationFrame: This polyfill provides a way to schedule animations or other tasks to occur at the most optimal time for the browser.

// Fetch: This polyfill allows you to use the modern Fetch API in older browsers that don't natively support it.
