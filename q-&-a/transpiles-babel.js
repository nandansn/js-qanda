// In JavaScript, transpiling is the process of converting code written in one version of the language (such as ES6 or ES7) into code that is compatible with an older version of the language (such as ES5). This is done so that the code can run in older web browsers that don't support the latest features and syntax of JavaScript.

// Babel is a popular JavaScript transpiler that can convert modern JavaScript code into older versions of the language. It can be configured to target specific versions of JavaScript, and can also be extended with plugins to add support for additional features or syntax.

// For example, Babel can convert code written using the ES6 arrow function syntax into the equivalent code that works in older browsers, like ES5 function expressions. It can also convert code using the ES6 let and const keywords into equivalent code using var, and convert other new features like template literals, destructuring, and async/await into code that works in older environments.

// By using a transpiler like Babel, developers can write code using the latest and greatest features of JavaScript without worrying about whether it will work in older browsers.
